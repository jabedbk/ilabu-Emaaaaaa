    <p>Ema, even when distance tries to steal our moments, my love for you leaps over them all. Every quiet breath whispers your name, reminding me of the future we dream of, hand in hand. Your smile paints sunshine in my soul. Each prayer carries my love, yearning for the day our paths intertwine, forever intertwined. I want us to be together in Jannah too. Regarding my job and career, I may not have everything figured out yet, I have faith in Allaah that He will save me. Be my guiding star, and let's write our story together, no matter what life throws our way. Though others may offer what seems better on the surface, I am steadfast in my belief that our connection is unmatched, I do believe we are best compatible for each other. No matter the circumstances, I want you to know that I am here for you, wholeheartedly and purely, ready to cherish and care for you always. And, I want you to be the same like this, only for me. Remember, no matter who comes and goes, my love for you burns brighter than any star, fueled by the hope of our happily ever after, InshaAllah.</p>
